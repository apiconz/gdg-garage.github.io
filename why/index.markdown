Why would anyone want to go to (or create) a GDG Garage? There are many reasons.

* _"My current employer/school doesn't challenge/stimulate me enough."_
* _"I want to get feedback on my personal project from fellow developers."_
* _"I want to learn from others."_
* _"Coding alone is half as fun."_
* _"Code reviews make my software better."_
* _"I've been working alone for a while and I think I'm going crazy."_
* _"I'd like to make like-minded friends."_
* _"I just want to code."_

But why does it _exist_, you ask? It is to make the developer community
more connected and friendlier.
