Why would anyone want to go to (or create) a GDG Garage? There are many reasons.

* _"My current employer/school doesn't <span class="c1">challenge/stimulate</span> me enough."_
* _"I want to get <span class="c2">feedback</span> on my personal project from fellow developers."_
* _"I want to <span class="c3">learn</span> from others."_
* _"Coding alone is half as <span class="c4">fun</span>."_
* _"<span class="c1">Code reviews</span> make my software better."_
* _"I've been working alone for a while and I think I'm <span
  class="c2">going crazy</span>."_
* _"I'd like to make like-minded <span class="c3">friends</span>."_
* _"I just want to <span class="c4">code</span>, period."_

But why does it _exist_, you ask? It is to make the developer community
<span class="c1">more connected and friendlier</span>.
