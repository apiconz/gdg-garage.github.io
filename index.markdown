GDG Garage is an <span class="c1">informal</span>, <span class="c2">hyperlocal</span> & <span class="c3">regular</span> meeting of developers.

<span class="c1">Informal</span> means that there is no speaker. People come and work together in small groups --- on whatever they feel like. <span class="c2">Hyperlocal</span> means it's a neighborhood thing. <img src="http://scr.templates.com/screenshots/illustrations/vector-illustration-of-a-toy-car-near-its-garage.1900.1917.jpg" class="illustration" />If you need to travel to a GDG Garage for more than 15 minutes, you are doing it wrong, and you should create your own. <span class="c3">Regular</span> means it happens monthly or weekly.

Think of GDG Garage as a D&D<small class="star">* <span>(Dungeons & Dragons, probably the most popular role-playing game)</span></small> session, but instead of dice and sheets of paper, you have laptops and code.

Or think of it as a local fitness center, but instead of excercising muscles, you excercise your coding skills.

These are the principles of GDG Garage:

1. <strong class="c1">Nobody is perfect</strong>
  * It's okay to ask for a code review<small class="star">* <span>(a way to peer-review your code; every line of code in Google needs to be code-reviewed before shipping)</span></small> or for help when you're stuck. Even Jeff
    Dean<small class="star">* <span>(a legendary coder; try googling 'Jeff Dean facts')</span></small> does it.
  * It's not okay to mock someone for not knowing something.
2. <strong class="c2">Try something new</strong>
  * Get out of your [comfort zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_zone). Are you a JavaScript guru? Say hello to `malloc()`. Are you a backend guy? Here's a couple of UX components!
  * It's easy to diss another programming language or development approach. It's much more difficult (and useful) to actually learn something about it.
3. <strong class="c3">Work in small groups</strong>
  * Don't work alone (you don't need a GDG Garage for that).
  * Don't work in larger groups (5+ people) --- it's [not effective](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/is-your-team-too-big-too-small-whats-the-right-number-2/).
4. <strong class="c4">Share your knowledge</strong>
  * Helping someone with their problem usually means you get to improve
    your own skills.
  * A little help today can lead to a huge collaboration in the future.
