<span class="c1">Programmers</span>. GDG Garage is for programmers.

There is <span class="c2">no required level of expertise</span>, and it's very much okay not to know everything. But it's kind of understood that if you go to a GDG Garage, you want to learn something new.

Hopefully, you'll be able to meet a lot of diffent people at your local
GDG Garage. Students, professionals, startupists, tinkerers. Javaists,
Rubyists, Pythonists, JavaScript'ists, C++'ers, Haskellians.
Front-end, back-end. Static typing, dynamic typing, optional typing.

As in Dungeon & Dragons, the diversity of the party (warrior, thief, 
mage, cleric) is not necessarily something to avoid. Sometimes, it is of utmost
importance!
