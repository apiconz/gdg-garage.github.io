  TBD.

<span class="c1">Anywhere</span>. Seriously. You can code in:

* an actual garage, 
* in a school,
* at a coworking space,
* at a caf√©,
* or at someone's place, even.

The point is that if you want to go, <span class="c2">you don't need to think too much
about it.</span> It's right there, couple of minutes away. You can just drop in
when you feel like it.

Find out where in your vicinity you can find GDG Garages that you can [join]({{ site.url }}/join/). 

<h3 class="c3">When do I go there?</h3>

Each GDG Garage sets their own time and periodicity. Preferrably, though, GDG Garage happens in the <span class="c4">evenings</span> on <span class="c1">workdays</span>, <span class="c2">every month or week</span>.
