So, you're interested in starting your own GDG Garage? Consider this an 
<span class="c1">admin's manual.</span>

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to start</h2>

You need to find a place, decide on day/time/periodicity, and find some fellow
garagists. See bellow for details.

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to prepare for the
first meeting</h2>

Here's a handy checklist:

* Print out the GDG Garage [logo][] on a couple of papers so you can use
  it as signage.
* Print out the [principles][] so you can hang them somewhere visible.
* Familiarize yourself with the different [projects][]. Be ready to
  offer a variety of them to the attendees.
* Prepare for the possibility that the internet connection will be down.
  (We all know that happens.)
* Make sure at least one other person is coming. You don't want to be on
  your first meeting completely alone.
* Come to the meeting 15-30 minutes in advance. Remember, this is your
  first meeting, something is bound not to go according to plan.

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to lead a meeting</h2>

In most cases, the meeting should run itself. People work with small
groups on stuff they find interesting. But --- as an admin ---
you are there to make sure that:

* nobody is alone (unless they really, _really_ want to),
* everyone knows what to do (offer [projects][] if they don't),
* everyone knows who to ask for help (in many cases, the answer is: you),
* the meeting is following the [principles][].

Other than that, enjoy!

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">What to do when someone (new) comes to a meeting</h2>

This is important: **You need to greet every comer and make sure they feel welcome.** If you've ever been to a social occasion where you just stood there and everyone was busy and you didn't want to bother anyone and it was awkward â€“ then you know why this _can't_ happen in a GDG Garage.

If they're new, learn who they are, tell them about your GDG Garage and introduce them (1 by 1) to others.

Regardless whether they're new or not, make sure they join someone or start a new group. Don't let them just politely sit there all by themselves. If need be, drop everything else and work in a 2 person group with them.

Someone's being difficult? Encourage them to start their own GDG Garage. No need to please every single attendee.
