So, you're interested in starting your own GDG Garage? Consider this an 
<span class="c1">admin's manual.</span>

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to start</h2>
TBD.

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to find a place</h2>
TBD.

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to choose time/day</h2>
TBD.

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to promote</h2>
TBD.

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to lead a meeting</h2>

Make sure that:

* nobody is alone (unless they really want to),
* everyone knows what to do (offer projects if they don't),
* everyone knows who to ask for help (in most cases, the answer is: you),
* the meeting is following the principles.

Other than that, enjoy!

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">What to do when someone (new) comes to a meeting</h2>

This is important: **You need to greet every comer and make sure they feel welcome.** If you've ever been to a social occasion where you just stood there and everyone was busy and you didn't want to bother anyone and it was awkward â€“ then you know why this _can't_ happen in a GDG Garage.

If they're new, learn who they are, tell them about your GDG Garage and introduce them (1 by 1) to others.

Regardless whether they're new or not, make sure they join someone or start a new group.

<h2 class="{% cycle 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' %}">How to solve issues</h2>

Someone's being difficult. Encourage them to start their own GDG Garage. No need to please every single attendee.
